# Card Memory game

> A simple Memory card game featuring the popular card game pokemon. The game is designed to help people of all ages improve their memory whilst also being entertaining and quick. The design is simplistic with the aim to keep focus on the cards, while the timer and move counter are easy to read but not distracting.

## UX
A simplistic and fresh looking website that introduces the user to a single player memory card game consisting of two pages with the popular pokemon game as the theme.


### Users Stories:
- As a user, I want a simplistic and easy to navigate website.

- As a user, I want to be able to use it on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

- As a user, I want to have a counter to keep track of how many moves I make to finish the game.

- As a user, I want to have a timer to keep track of how long it takes to finish the game.

- As a user, I want to have a restart button that resets all the features whenever I want.

- As a user, I want to see fun and eye catching images.

- As a user, I want easy to follow instructions.

- As a user, I want to improve my memory.

- As a user, I want a victory popup message to tell me when I've finished the game, displaying how many moves I made and the time it took
for me to finish the game. It should also have a button to play the game again.

## wireframes 
- for my wireframes i only needed to use a very basic format since it is only a simple memory card matching game and i wanted the same format(within reason) to be shared among desktops, tablets and phones.
