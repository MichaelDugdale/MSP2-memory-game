##### Second Milestone Project
# Card Memory game

> A memory card game featuring images of Star Wars characters in lego form which I found amusing, fun and cute. The game is for users of all ages who 
would like to improve their memory whilst also enjoy looking at the images too.
The website consists of the main page with beautiful quality photos, pleasing to the eye, inspiring to look at and simple, not too 
much text, as for myself I don’t like busy looking websites, I like simplicity and beauty. As too much information gets confusing, messy 
and overwhelming.

## UX
A simple and clean looking website that introduces the user to a single player memory card game consisting of one page:
- A clean, simple look, with succinct instructions.
- The cards are quite large in order to enjoy the images better.
- When the player has finished/won the game, a popup modal matching the colours of the images appears
giving the user the time it took for them to finish and how many moves they made and the choice to play again.
- At the bottom of the card images is a simple and clean scoreboard consisting of a moves counter, minutes and seconds timer 
and the restart button.

#### Users Stories:
- As a user, I want a simple and clean looking website as messy, busy pages with lots of information overwhelms me.

- As a user, I want an easy to navigate website to save time and not get frustrated or lost.

- As a user, I want to be able to use it on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

- As a user, I want to have a counter to keep track of how many moves I make to finish the game.

- As a user, I want to have a timer to keep track of how long it takes to finish the game.

- As a user, I want to have a restart button that resets all the features whenever I want.

- As a user, I want a victory popup message to tell me when I've finished the game, displaying how many moves I made and the time it took
for me to finish the game. It should also have a button to play the game again.

- As a user, I want to see interesting, quality images.

- As a user, I don't want the popup message to cover the images when I've finished the game so I can see them all properly.

- As a user, I want to see interesting and fun images some easy to memorise and some not so easy.

- As a user, I want simple instructions.

- As a user, I want to challenge my brain and exercise my memory.
